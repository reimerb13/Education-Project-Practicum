# Colorado High School Graduation Rates by Location

# Project Summary

The objective of this project is to use a specific data set to predict whether or not geographic location, such as metropolitan vs. rural areas, has an effect on high school graduation rates in Colorado. Each area is composed of different student populations based on gender and race.  The following is a dilemma which confronts many people in education: What data can be used to determine graduation rates amongst different counties in Colorado based on length of time.  Gaining insight into this dilemma will help the state of Colorado focus on which areas, metropolitan or rural, should be targeted to assist in improving graduation rates.

# Data Collection

The data was collected from the Colorado Department of Education website. The dataset chosen was an Excel file titled 'Graduates and Completers by Districts, Gender, and Race/Ethnicityâ€™.

# The Graduate Dataset

The Graduate dataset contains 750 observations and 125 variables. Some of the variables that the dataset has includes the following:

County Name: Name of county where schools are located

Organization Name: Name of school/organization

"Class Of..." Anticipated Year of Graduation Cohort: Specific graduation year (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020)

Number of Years After Entering High School: Number of years after a student entered high school (4,5,6 or 7)

All Students Graduates Total: Number of students who graduated at a school/organization during a specific school year

All Students Graduation Rate: Graduation rate of students (in percentage) in 4, 5, 6, or 7 years from high school

All Students Completion Rate: Completion rate of students (in percentage) in 4, 5, 6, or 7 years from high school

# Libraries Used in Python

Here is the list of libraries used to complete the education project in Python:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn

# Data Preparation

The dataset, df, was uploaded into a Jupyter notebook using Anaconda. To begin preparing the data, the first five rows were dropped above because they were the totals from all of the data columns. These rows were excluded so that the main focus was the data without the data totals. The summary statistics of df was then determined and also the number of missing or NA values were calculated. The mean value for each column was imputed for the NA values and a new dataset was created (df2).

After the df2 dataset was created, the first five rows of the df2 dataset were removed since they were the totals for each data column. The summary statistics of df2 was then calculated. After seeing the summary statistics of df2, multiple boxplots were created to see if any outliers exist in the df2 data.

The df2 data was then split into 4 different geographic regions: Metro, Western Slope/Mountain, Eastern Plains, and Southwestern. 

# Metro Data

The Metro data subset consisted of 10 different counties: El Paso, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Adams, Denver, Douglas, Boulder, Larimer, Clear Creek, and Gilpin. The summary statistics for the Metro data were calculated and then the top five counties where the total number of females completed high school.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

During the exploratory data analysis, the male and female graduation rates were the primary focus based on ethnicities in each region. The ethnicity groups used were Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and Other (Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). The summary statistics were found for each ethnicity in each region. The number of outliers were also calculated as well by ethnicity.

Female and Male Graduation Rates in Metro Counties by Ethnicity

|Ethnicity|Mean Graduation Rate|Number of Outliers|
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
|Asian|14.2%|2|
|Black|12.6%|2|
|Hispanic|12.7%|2|
|White|13.1%|2|
|Other|12.3%|4|

It was clear that the Asian ethnicity has the best graduation rate in Metro Counties. The most outliers occurred in the Other ethnicity.

Female and Male Graduation Rates in Western Counties by Ethnicity

|Ethnicity|Mean Graduation Rate|Number of Outliers|
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
|Asian|6.2%|0|
|Black|5.5%|0|
|Hispanic|5.7%|0|
|White|6.2%|0|
|Other|5.4%|0|

The Asian and White ethnicities had the best graduation rates in Western Counties. There were no outliers in the Western data.

Female and Male Graduation Rates in Eastern Counties by Ethnicity

|Ethnicity|Mean Graduation Rate|Number of Outliers|
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
|Asian|14.3%|2|
|Black|12.6%|2|
|Hispanic|13.8%|2|
|White|14.3%|2|
|Other|12.5%|4|

The Asian and White ethnicities had the best graduation rates in Eastern counties. The most outliers occurred in the Other ethnicity.

Female and Male Graduation Rates in Southwestern Counties by Ethnicity

|Ethnicity|Mean Graduation Rate|Number of Outliers|
|---------|--------------------|------------------|
|Asian|8.1%|2|
|Black|7.0%|2|
|Hispanic|7.9%|2|
|White|8.0%|1|
|Other|7.1%|3|

The Asian ethnicity had the best graduation rate in Southwestern Counties. The most outliers occurred in the Other ethinicity.

Due to the small number of outliers, they were left into the dataset since they wouldn't have an enormous effect on the results.

# Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) 

The first machine learning task completed was creating artificial neural networks (ANN). Eight different ANN models were created to correctly predict the graduation rates based on region (Metro, Western, Eastern, or Southwestern), gender (Male or Female), and ethnicity (Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic, and White). The counties for each region were reclassified into numeric values in order to complete the ANN models. The data was split into 70:30 ratio for training and testing datasets.

The ANN models for the Metro data consisted of three hidden layers of 25 and a max iteration of 3,000. Below is a table of the results. 

|Gender|Precision|f1-Score|County with Best Results|
|------|----------|---------|-------------------------|
|Female|54%|55%|El Paso County|
|Male|53%|50%|El Paso County|

The ANN model for the female Western data consisted of three hidden layers of 100 and a max of iteration of 1,000. The ANN model for the male Western data consisted of three hidden layers of 50 and a max of iteration of 1,000. Below is a table of the results.

|Gender|Precision|f1-Score|County with Best Results|
|------|----------|---------|-------------------------|
|Female|18%|16%|Jackson County|
|Male|21%|13%|County 13|

The ANN model for the female Eastern data consisted of three hidden layers of 50 and a max iteration of 1,000. The ANN model for the male Eastern data 
consisted of three hidden layers of 50 an a max iteration of 3,000. Below is a table of the results.

|Gender|Precision|f1-Score|County with Best Results|
|------|----------|---------|-------------------------|
|Female|2%|3%|County 6|
|Male|12%|9%|County 12|

The ANN model for the female Southwestern data consisted of three hidden layers of 100 and a max iteration of 3,000. The ANN model for the male Southwestern
data consisted of three hidden layers of 50 and a max iteration of 3,000. Below is a table of the results.

|Gender|Precision|f1-Score|County with Best Results|
|------|----------|---------|-------------------------|
|Female|22%|14%|County 6|
|Male|22%|17%|County 17|

# Decision Trees

After completing the ANN models, decision trees were created for each region, gender, and ethnicities. Below is a table of the results.

|Region|Gender|Accuracy Rate|
|------|------|-------------|
|Metro|Female|45%|
|Metro|Male|34%|
|Western|Female|14%|
|Western|Male|11%|
|Eastern|Female|13%|
|Eastern|Male|10%|
|Southwestern|Female|13%|
|Southwestern|Male|15%|
